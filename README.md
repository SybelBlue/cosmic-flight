## Game
 - The goal is to terraform all the asteroids into planets and return to a livable planet in as few flights as possible
 - Terraform an asteroid by landing, then going to a planet
   - Once an asteroid has a flag on it, it will be terraformed the next time the rocket lands on a planet
 - Aim by dragging and rotating the rocket when it's landed -- the farther away you drag, the more power (represented by fire)
 - Peek around space by dragging when the rocket is flying!
